        <h2>Now that you are called, What now?</h2>
        <div id="cols">
          <p class="col1">
            Have you recently been called as a new librarian or maybe you are now working in the nursery or even called as the Elder's Quorum or Relief Society president of your ward.  It can all be very daunting and, sad to say, the training given for your position may be less than what you were hoping for.  No need to stress out about it though.  President Thomas S. Monson has given you the assurance that "God qualifies those He calls" so you can be assured that your Father in Heaven understands your needs and has pointed you in the right direction.  Called to Serve is here to help you with resources to help you magnify your calling.
          </p>
          <p class="col2">
            This site was built to help you in whatever calling you may have.  The menus will point you to the specific organization you are serving in.  From there, you can locate your specific calling and find the resources to
            help you better serve in that calling.  We have compiled an impressive set of tools to assist you in being
            successful in your service and comfortable in your calling.  Check the other callings as well as you never
            know when you will need to serve in some other capacity.  You may even be able to assist others in learning
            how they can serve more fully as well.
