        <h2>Elder's Quorum</h2>

            As stated in D&amp;C 20:38-45 "The duty of the elders, priests, teachers, deacons, and members of the church of Christ—An apostle is an elder, and it is his calling to baptize;
            And to ordain other elders, priests, teachers, and deacons;
            And to administer bread and wine—the emblems of the flesh and blood of Christ—
            And to confirm those who are baptized into the church, by the laying on of hands for the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, according to the scriptures;
            And to teach, expound, exhort, baptize, and watch over the church;
            And to confirm the church by the laying on of the hands, and the giving of the Holy Ghost;
            And to take the lead of all meetings.
            The elders are to conduct the meetings as they are led by the Holy Ghost, according to the commandments and revelations of God."
          </p>
          <p class="col2">
            As stated in the Church Handbook of Instructions - Book 2 Section 7.1.1.1 "Worthy brethren may receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and be ordained elders when they are at least 18 years old. The rights and responsibilities of elders are revealed in Doctrine and Covenants. Elders also hold the authority of deacons, teachers, and priests." <br>
            Another duty of an Elder can be found in D&amp;C 42:44 "And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me." This blessing of the sick and afflicted as well as blessings of comfort
            and counsel are the most powerful service Elders can do for the members and for the world in general.
